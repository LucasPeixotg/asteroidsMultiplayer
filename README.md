It's a simple asteroids game, but that you can play with your friends on a local network.\n
# How to play
If you want to play offline you just need to run client/client.py. But if you want to play with your friends you will need to run server/server.py first, and then the client/client.py.\n
It's simple and maybe in the future I add more enemies or something like this. But ENJOY. :)
