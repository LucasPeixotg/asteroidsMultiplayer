<h1 align=center>Asteroids Multiplayer</h1>
<p>It's a simple asteroids game, but that you can play with your friends on a local network.</p>
<h2>How to play </h2>
<p>If you want to play offline you just need to run client/client.py. But if you want to play with your friends you will need to run server/server.py first, and then the client/client.py.</p>
<p>It's simple and maybe in the future I add more enemies or something like this. But ENJOY. :)</p>
