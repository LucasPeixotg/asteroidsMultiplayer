<h1 align=center>Asteroids Multiplayer</h1>
<p>It's a simple asteroids game, but that you can play with your friends on a local network.</p>
<h2>How to play </h2>
<p>
First of all, install python 3, then run the following:<br/>
pip install pygame<br/>
Then, download the zip file, unzip it and open the folder in the terminal.<br/>
if you want to play offline you just need to run client.py, with: <br/>
python3 client/client.py <br/>
But if you want to play with your friends, you will need to run server/server.py first, with: <br/>
python3 server/server.py<br/>
And then the client/client.py. obs: Your friends need to be on the same network that you.</p>
<p>It's simple and maybe in the future I add more enemies or something like this. But ENJOY. :)</p>
